**Abstract:**   
Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) ligands activate a signaling cascade with
multiple cell context dependent outcomes. Disruption or disturbance leads to
variant clinical disorders. To develop strategies for disease intervention,
delineation of the pathway in further detail is required. Current theoretical
models of this pathway describe production and degradation of signal mediating
proteins and signal transduction from the cell surface into the nucleus,
whereas feedback loops have not exhaustively been included. In this study we
present a mathematical model to determine the relevance of feedback regulators
(Arkadia, Smad7, Smurf1, Smurf2, SnoN and Ski) on TGF-β target gene expression
and the potential to initiate stable oscillations within a realistic parameter
space. We employed massive sampling of the parameters space to pinpoint
crucial players for potential oscillations as well as transcriptional product
levels. We identified Smad7 and Smurf2 with the highest impact on the
dynamics. Based on these findings, we conducted preliminary time course
experiments.
